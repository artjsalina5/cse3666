# Math 

We need some basic math skills in this course.

* Solve linear equations
* Ratio
* Compute average

## Find the unknowns 

If we know the relationship of $n$ varaibles and we know
the $n-1$ values, we can find the value of the unkown.

For example, if we know th

distance=time√óspeed

## Ratio

## Average
