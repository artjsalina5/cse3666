# Math 

We need some basic math skills in this course.

* Solve linear equations
* Ratio
* Compute average

## Find the unknowns 

If we know the relationship of _n_ varaibles and the value of _n-1_ variables,
we can find the value of the remaining one.

For example, we know  

$$ d = t \times v $$

where $$d$$ is distance, $$t$$ is time, and $$v$$ is velocity. When 
we know the value of two of the three variables, we can calculate the third.


## Ratio

## Average
