# Math 

We need some basic math skills in this course.

* Solve (simple) equations 
* Apply ratio
* Compute average

## Find the unknowns 

If we know the relationship of _n_ varaibles and the value of _n-1_ variables,
we can find the value of the remaining one.

For example, given

$$ d = t \times v $$

where $$d$$ is distance, $$t$$ is time, and $$v$$ is velocity, if 
we know the value of two of the three variables, we can calculate the third.

If a car travels 60 miles/hour for two hours, the distance it has travelled
is 

$$ d = t \times v = 2 * 60 = 120 $$ miles.

If one runs 3 miles in 30 minutes (i.e., 0.5 hours), the average speed in miles
per hour is 

$$ v = \frac{d}{t} = \frac{3}{0.5} = 6 $$.
