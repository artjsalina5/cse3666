# RISC-V Resources

## RISC-V 

* [RISC-V Official spec](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/) 
We only need Volumn 1.
* [RISC-V Github repo](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual)
* [Calling convenion](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.md)

## RARS

Of course, RARS goes first. RARS is written in Java and built upon MARS, 
a MIPS simulator, which we used in CSE 3666 before switching to RISC-V.

## Online simulator at Cornell

Cornell has an online simulator for their CS3410.

## Venus

"venus is a RISC-V instruction set simulator built for education."

Venus is written in Kotlin.
