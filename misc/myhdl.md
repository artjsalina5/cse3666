# MyHDL Resources

We pick MyHDL, out of many options, because students taking CSE 3666 should
have learned Python and MyHDL is similar to Verilog.

The following are links to some very useful resources. See the MyHDL Github
repo for installatino instructions. 

* [MyHDL Github Repo](https://github.com/myhdl/myhdl)

* [MyHDL manual](http://docs.myhdl.org/en/stable/manual/index.html)

* [A collection of Resources](https://github.com/xesscorp/myhdl-resources)

* [RTL design in Python](http://www.es.ele.tue.nl/~jhuisken/mmips/mMips_in_Myhdl.pdf)

# Verilog

Verilog is a popluar HDL. It is also the language used in textbook examples.
You will find Verilog and MyHDL have many similar concepts and even keywords.
It would be a fun project to learn Verilog and get a working RISC-V core on an
FPGA.

* [Veritut](http://www.asic-world.com/verilog/veritut.html)

* [FPGA designs with Verilog](https://verilogguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

* [A FPGA board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/451). It should be good enough for a 32-bit RISC-V core. 

[Icarus Verilog (iverilog)](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) has good support for Verilog 2005 (1364-2005). The
compiled code has small foot print and it is fast. 

[EDA playgrond](https://www.edaplayground.com/) provides an online environment
where one can play with many HDLs. It requires a free account to actually
simulate the design.  There are many other online Verilog simulators. 

# Other 

* [HDL](https://github.com/drom/awesome-hdl). Many high level HDLs.

* nMigen is another Python package. It is based on [The Fragmented Hardware
  Description Language (FHDL)](https://m-labs.hk/migen/manual/fhdl.html), which
is quite different from traditional event driven languages like MyHDL.
