RARS (RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator) is written in Java and built upon
MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator), which we used in CSE 3666 when
MIPS was taught in the course. 

[RARS Github repo is here.](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars)

## Install Java

We will need Java to run RARS. Java is already installed in lab computers. If
you would like to install it on your own computer, please find the installation
instructions on the Internet for the operating system you use. 


### Windows

You can download and install Java manually. Here is 
[Jave download link at Java.com](https://java.com/en/download/windows_manual.jsp).
As of August 2021, the version is Version 8 update 301.

You can also use package management software to install. For example, 
the Chocolatey package is [here](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/jre8). 

### Linux

There are many tutorials on the Internet, for different editions/versions of Linux.
For example, [this page on DigitalOcean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-on-ubuntu-20-04) has the instructions to install Java on Ubuntu 20.04.

## Download RARS

Download RARS from [RARS Github repo.](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars).
