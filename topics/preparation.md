# Preparation

## Some basic concepts in Computer Science/Engineering

Khan Academy has several units on the basics of computer systems. Units 1 and 2
on the following page are relevant to CSE 3666. Please review "Bits and bytes",
"Binary numbers", "Hexadecimal numbers", "Limitations of storing numbers" in
Unit 1, and all topics in Unit 2.

[Computers and the Internet](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet)

[dec2bin.md](dec2bin.md) also discusses number conversions.

One can practice number conversions on the following page.

## Programming and Python

CSE 2050 is one of the prerequisites. Students are expected to know programming
and Python. We will use a Python module to design digital logic in the course.  

There are many problems on [USACO contests
page](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=contests).  The submission can be in
Python. There are four divisions. Students who have taken CSE 2050 should try
the Silver or a higher level.

## C 

Simple C programs will be used in CSE 3666 to show operations needed in
software. [This C
file](https://github.com/zhijieshi/cse3666/blob/master/code-examples/c-example.c)
has the essentials we need to know about C language.
 
## Skills

Practice self learning and problem solving often.
