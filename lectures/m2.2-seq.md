### Sequential circuit

The output of a sequential circuit depends the current input
and the history of previous input. Therefore, we need clock
and *memory elements*.

### D flip-flop, Register, and Register File

A postive edge triggered D flip-flop stores a bit at the rising edge (positive
edge).  

A register stores bits. For simplicity, we can assume it is implemented with D
flip-flop.

A register file consists of a colleciton of registers. 

The register file in RISC-V has two read ports and one write port.

### State machine

A state machine keeps the summary of previous input, called state, in *memory
elements*,  for example, D flip-flops. A state machine is synchronous. There is
a clock and all bits in state are updated at the same time.

There two combinational components in a state machine. One generates output 
of the machine and the other generates the state for the next cycle. Both
take as input the current state and the current input to the state machine. 

We take a 16-bit accumulator as an example.

#### Timing requirements

In a cycle, a state machine goes through the following phases:

* Update state. New state is stored in registers.

* Computing. Combinational circuit generates output and new state.

* New state is presented to registers to meet the set up time requirements. 

### Memory

The (main) memory module in computer is for storing large amounts of data.
Compared to register file, memory is cheaper (per bit) and slower. 

The input to a memory module includes the following.

* Address 
* Write data, to be writtent to the address during write operation
* MemWrite, asserted to enable write
* MemRead, asserted to enable read
* Read data. Data read from the address during read operation
