### Representation of real numbers with bits

Read binary numbers with fraction.

```
0b111.0111
```

Convert a real number (in decimal) to binary.

### IEEE 754 Standard

IEEE 754 Standard specifies how to represent real numbers with 32 bits and 64 bits. 

The basic idea is to normalize the representaton into the following form, and
then keep sign, fraction, and exponent in the binary representaton.

```
+/- (1 + fraction) * 2 ** (exponent)
```

Fraction is in [0, 1).

The allocaton of bits for different fields are listed in the following table.

<table>
<tr><th>&nbsp</th><th>Single precision</th><th>Double precision</th></tr>
<tr><td>Total number of bits</td><td>32</td><td>64</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sign</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of bits in exponent</td><td>8</td><td>11</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of bits in fraction</td><td>23</td><td>52</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bias in exponent encoding</td><td>127</td><td>1023</td></tr>
</table>

The standard also includes denormalized numbers that are smaller than normal numbers.
The hidden bit in denormalized numbers are 0. 

### RISC-V Support for Floating-Point Numbers

RISC-V F extension supports single-precision floatng point numbers.

RISC-V D extension supports double-precision floatng point numbers.
D extension is a superset of F extension.

There are 32 floating-point registers: `f0`, `f1`, ..., `f32`.
`f0` is not sepcial. It can keep non-zero values.

In D extension, a register, for example, `f0` or `f11`, can hold either a
single precision or a double precision number.

The instructions in RISC-V F and D extensions include:

```
# load and store
flw, fsw, fld, fsd

# arithmetic
fadd.s, fsub.s, fmul.s, fdiv.s, fsqrt.s
fadd.d, fsub.d, fmul.d, fdiv.d, fsqrt.d

# comparison. result is saved in integer registers
f.eq.s, f.lt.s, f.le.s
f.eq.d, f.lt.d, f.le.d
```

The floating-point arguments are passed to functions in register `fa0`, `fa1`,
..., `fa7`. The register numbers are `f10`, `f11`, ..., `f17`, respectively.
The return values are in `fa0` and `fa1`.
